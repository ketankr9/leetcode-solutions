 * Testcase Example:  '[1,0,1,0,1,0,1]'
 *
 * Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path
 * represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For
 * example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent
 * 01101 in binary, which is 13.
 * 
 * For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path
 * from the root to that leaf.
 * 
 * Return the sum of these numbers.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
 * Output: 22
 * Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 1000.
 * node.val is 0 or 1.
 * The answer will not exceed 2^31 - 1.
