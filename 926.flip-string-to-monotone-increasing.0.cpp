 * Testcase Example:  '"00110"'
 *
 * A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some
 * number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly
 * 0.)
 * 
 * We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1'
 * or a '1' to a '0'.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of flips to make SÂ monotone increasing.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "00110"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "010110"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "00011000"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= S.length <= 20000
 * S only consists of '0' and '1' characters.
